In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and
controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined
security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted
network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet. The term firewall
originally referred to a wall intended to confine a fire within a line of
adjacent buildings.
