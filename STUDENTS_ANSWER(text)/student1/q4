A firewall is a network security system that helps in monitoring and
controlling both the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on
provided security rules. A firewall establishes a barrier between a trusted
network and an untrusted network such as the Internet. The term firewall
was originally referred to a wall used to confine a fire within a line of
adjacent buildings.
