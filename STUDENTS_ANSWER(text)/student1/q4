 

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer fight royale game created and
distributed by PUBG Corporation, an auxiliary of South Korean computer game organization
Bluehole. The game depends on past mods that were made by Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene
for different games, roused by the 2000 Japanese movie Battle Royale, and ventured into an
independent game under Greene's innovative heading. In the game, up to 100 players parachute
onto an island and rummage for weapons and hardware to execute others while trying not to get
murdered themselves. The accessible safe region of the game's guide diminishes in size over the
long haul, guiding enduring players into more tight regions to drive experiences. The last player or
group standing successes the round.
